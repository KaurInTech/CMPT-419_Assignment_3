"Use Your Garage as a Hobby Space
Your garage is a very important part of your home. While most homeowners use their garage to store their cars, there are also many other uses. 1st Rate Garage Doors has a few tips on using your garage for your favorite hobbies.
Make Your Hobby Space Unique
Think of your garage as an extension of your home. Most homeowners store personal things, tools, or recreational equipment in their garage. If you’re willing to park your car in the driveway, you can convert your garage into an extra entertainment space.
What are your favorite hobbies? Whether it’s video games, a laundry room or crafting, your garage can serve as a place for the things you like to do. After you pick a theme for your space, you’re ready to get to work.
Converting Your Garage
There are several things to consider when converting your garage into a hobby space. If you’re going to spend plenty of time here, think of this area as another living space. If you think your space is not convertible, then seek advice from an expert. They can help make it work for you.
Check the Foundation
Check the flooring foundation before you begin converting. You don’t want to start working on a unstable foundation. Check for any cracks or gaps and make plans to fill those in.
Consider A Flooring Change
Most people want their hobby spaces to look inviting. Consider making a simple upgrade to your flooring. You can make this a simple process with latex paint, tiles, or epoxy. Also, make sure there’s plenty of insulation under the flooring.
Add Some Windows
Do you want natural light in your space? Consider adding a few windows to brighten up the room. Windows will also help with heating during the winter months.
Build Some Shelves
Don’t forget about adding some shelf space no matter what your hobby is. Building shelves into the walls or against them will keep your items off the floor. This leaves more room for your hobby area.
Entry Doors
Does your garage have a door that leads into your home? If not, it’s a good idea to add one. A door helps with air circulation and easy access into your home.
Don’t Forget The Essentials
After you concentrate on the major areas, don’t forget the helpful details. Consider essentials such as:
● Heating and cooling – Changes are your garage doesn’t have central heating or cooling. An electrician will wire your space and help install heating and cooling in the garage. You can also install simple fans if you don’t want the cost of air conditioning.
● Security camera – Installation security is important for your safety. If your home already has cameras installed, then add another to your garage space.
● Dehumidifier – A garage can harbor moisture that will damage your items. Run a dehumidifier to reduce the moisture in the air.
These are just a few things to think about for your hobby space.

"Scientists that has suggested a link between the expression of these tumor-suppressing RNAs and other types of cancer.
The next step was to determine whether restoring miR-15/16 inside cells could help the body to fight mesothelioma. To test this, researchers injected synthetic miR mimics packaged in “minicells” into the mesothelioma-bearing mice.
The results were encouraging. Not only did restoring miR-15/16 expression inhibit the growth of mesothelioma cells, but it also appeared to make them more sensitive to chemotherapy with pemetrexed and gemcitabine, two of the most popular first-line drugs for mesothelioma. According to the report, injections of the miR-15/16 mimics led to “consistent and dose-dependent inhibition of malignant pleural mesothelioma tumor growth”. The team concludes that this miRNA-targeting method may offer a new way to combat this aggressive cancer.
Mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, is a major problem in Australia, which has one of the highest rates of the disease in the world. Because the early stages of the disease usually occur years after exposure and produce very few symptoms, mesothelioma is often not diagnosed until it is in its advanced stages, making treatment even more challenging. Australia has banned the mining, use and importation of asbestos products, but continues to pay a heavy price – in the form of mesothelioma, asbestos and other diseases – for decades of asbestos use.

Needle in a haystack : entity search on text and graph
Submitted by Uma Sawant (@umasawant) on Tuesday, 1 May 2018
Abstract
Web search today is moving towards displaying “answers” rather than making the user browse through pages to find what they want. “Entity” search queries, where the expected answer is a list or a set of objects; form more than 40% of today’s Web search. Yet the current approaches for answering such queries are quite brittle.
We improve the state-of-the-art by infusing the semantic information of entities, their types and inter-relations into free text from Web documents. The result is a much more robust QA engine. In this talk, we will discuss the challenges in Web-scale entity search, our approach of combining structured and unstructured information and how that allows us to answer user queries better.

"VIDEO: Rich Clune — yes, Rich Clune — scores on a penalty shot
-

- Updated: March 12, 2013
The Nashville Predators beat the Dallas Stars, 4-0, tonight but the real story was the unlikely penalty shot goal scorer.
Tough guy Rich Clune was hauled down on a breakaway by Stars defenseman Jordie Benn midway through the contest. As a result, the Preds winger — who had scored his first NHL goal just 36 days earlier — was awarded a penalty shot.
When asked by radio analyst and former NHLer Stu Grimson if he had ever scored on a penalty shot, Clune replied “If you do your research on the internet, you’ll be able to pull up my stats from my last year in junior in Barrie where I went four-for-four in shootouts. 100 percent no lie.”
The hashtag #100PercentNoLie” appeared promptly on Twitter and no doubt will become a season-long thing.
Nashville is now 3-0-0 when Clune scores a goal. Additionally, they have scored at least four goals in each of those games as well.

Nutrisystem Review
Open the Box, Eat the Food, Lose the Weight!
Losing weight has never been easier for you to work with.. You’re only required to do three things for each meal. Open the box, eat the food and lose the weight. It’s that simple!
A Variety of New Foods
The Nutrisystem program is now updated with a number of brand new foods that will help you get the most out of your diet. Everything you eat will be based off of the glycemic index, a key measurement that helps you to keep from eating the wrong things while on your diet.
There are more than 150 different foods for breakfast, lunch, dinner and desert. You can choose from all sorts of different choices including thirty different brand new dishes. These new dishes include such popular options as Chicken Parmesan Melt, Spicy Kung Pao Noodles and Loaded Baked Potato.
It even comes with some unique desserts that you’d never expect to find in any diet. You can just open the box, eat your Streusel Muffin or Stuffed Apple Pie among other unique dessert options and lose weight.
Everything that is made available for you on this diet is made with only the right measurement of fiber, protein and carbs. This should help you to lose weight without providing you with more food than what your body can afford to take in.
In fact, this diet will work well no matter what your situation is. Nutrisystem offers different choices for men, women and diabetics. Each program is engineered with the right food options for every single client who needs weight loss help.
It also makes you feel a little more comfortable when trying to get to the Now I Can Moment you’ve always wanted. There’s no need to count calories, points or anything else. Also, you don’t have to deal with annoying weigh-ins when dieting.
Dinners on Your Own
The Nutrisystem diet traditionally helps you out by using simple foods that are delivered to your door alongside fresh grocery items to help you balance your diet. However, you can also take advantage of the Dinners on Your Own program.
Nutrisystem will help you out by providing you the freedom to go with whatever food you want to use for dinner each day. This is made with the intention of helping you to find the right foods for your specific weight loss needs without risking any weight gain in the process.
Weekends on Your Own
The Weekends on Your Own program is another unique part of the diet that will help you the most. This allows you five days of quality food from Nutrisystem while providing you with more flexibility during the weekends. This includes helping you choose healthy foods that you can choose from on the weekends. This program of the diet is a means of helping you to figure out better choices for yourself.
This is an extension of the Dinners on Your Own program in that it helps you to stick to the plan. It makes it so you can feel more comfortable with your food choices no matter what you choose to use in your diet.
Reach Your “Now I Can Moment”
A main point about the program is that it makes it easier for you to reach the “Now I Can Moment” that you’ve always wanted to get into. Nutrisystem has worked in many cases for individuals where other diets have failed. Nutrisystem even guarantees that you will have success when you are on this diet.
You can get your “Now I Can Moment” with food that has been known to help others lose nearly forty percent more weight than on their own. It all comes with the quality foods that you would come to expect out of the company.
Strong Guarantees
Nutrisystem is so confident in you getting to that “Now I Can Moment” that it is offering a number of different specials dedicated to helping you out with losing weight. For instance, you will get a full refund if you are not comfortable with the diet. Your satisfaction is completely guaranteed while using it.
Free Features
In addition, you can enjoy all sorts of features that go beyond just opening the box, eating the food and losing weight. You’ll also receive access to a number of Nutrisystem membership tools online. These include many trackers and support services that will help you to keep on track with your diet. This is all made to help you out with improving your body.
Be sure to see what new features are coming this year with the Nutrisystem program. You can work with many new foods this year to help you reach that “Now I Can Moment” you’ve always wanted. It’s all done with smart choices and even with some freedom for you on the weekends and evenings. It is all guaranteed to give you the best possible weight loss result that you could ever ask for.",http://www.healthy-dietplans.com/coupons/nutrisystem/,2014-10-20 08:04:51,CC-MAIN-2014-42,1413507442288.9,"[array(['http://media.healthy-dietplans.com/wp-content/plugins/wp-coupon/images/dark.png',

"Hello there!
It’s been a while since the last time I posted here in my blog. So many things happened in my life… so many special occasions cherished and blessings shared; birthdays, Christmas, New Year, valentines etc. 2015 has been so good to me that the Lord gave us one of the biggest gift, at last after more than 10 long years I will be having my baby again. I am on 18 weeks now so far so good I just hope for a healthy, safe and worry free pregnancy, though it’s been difficult for me not to worry too much because of the previous miscarriages that I considered myself high risk . I am trying to take one day at a time no stress and continue to pray hard, hold on to my faith and for sure Lord Jesus will protect and take care of us.

"The recently published article “Is design thinking a failed experiment?” by John Coyle, resonated in my head as I revisited one of my latest projects. Last year I was collaborating in a 6 month project, as user experience designer to bring design thinking practice and service design awareness within a financial institution, for the wholesale bank teams.
As Coyle points out in his article the key item for a successful venture like this is in the mindset of our leaders.
Our corporations are misusing design thinking by looking at it as a process brought in by external resources, with specific knowledge and expertise on this subject. Instead of looking within the internal capability they have to change. By changing their own mindset, which in turn leads to an inclusive, and internal use of intelligence and resources. This implies a different perspective and skill set.
This change in the mindset is at the base of creativity. And creativity is the foundation of any project. It allows space for exploration onto new grounds to frame problems differently.
Back to my project, with each of the teams I collaborated with, I saw no support from the organisation itself. Leaders were absent and all team members were working double. They were both dedicated to developing their ideia for the next 6 months, and expected to keep up their regular work which they have been doing for most part of their professional life.
There was no setup to give these people, these creators, the room to be creative. There were no leaders standing behind them, facilitating the space and clearing up path for them to grow, and educate themselves in looking differently at the problems they identified.
The result was constant communication mismatch between designers, managers, and teams. We all had completely different expectations on the work methods and this influenced the way we co-worked.
It became a frustration for both sides when working on deliverables, and the resulting outcomes and strategies were a challenge.
I believe Coyle really nails it when he answers the question: “Why do companies get it wrong?”
“Despite this self-acknowledged deficit, where do companies put their investment into innovation? Into strategy, governance, and process. Most companies demand innovation from their leaders, and have NOTHING in their leadership development programs to teach creativity, design thinking or creative problem solving. They are solving the WRONG PROBLEM! Which brings us back to the core premise of design thinking – which is ensuring you are answering the right central question. In this case instead of “how do we institute an innovation process” in our firm, a better question might be “how do we create an innovation mindset in our leaders?”
I will stress out again:
“…where do companies put their investment into innovation? Into strategy, governance, and process. Most companies demand innovation from their leaders, and have NOTHING in their leadership development programs to teach creativity, design thinking or creative problem solving. “…how do we create an innovation mindset in our leaders?”
He then proceeds by referring to a source:
“Bruce (Nussbaum) argues much the same suggesting a new kind of intelligence quotient be developed: we had IQ, then EQ, he now suggests a “CQ” – a creative quotient of intelligence.”
This is what I have missed. A chance to talk to leaders and understand their mindset, to understand what they see as innovation and creativity. Only then is there a truthful, meaningful conversation instead of endless days filled with missing opportunities.
A better working experience and environment could be changed by starting with that question, understanding what leaders see in projects as these, and get them involved in the process, continuously.
Perhaps, instead of overwhelming teams with days of heavy loaded workshops on tools and processes, organise creative days were teams are challenged and exposed to new ways of thinking. Leaders should also be involved in these creative sessions, to give support and trust, while being continuously assessed on their CQ in order to become ambassadors of creative thinking within the organisations.
In his conclusion Coyle points out the importance of the quotient of intelligence for the success of design thinking. I agree, and the leaders who develop, implement and spread it, will become the game changers that can transform organisations as we know them.
What other ideas do you have for applying creative thinking within organisations? What are your experiences and challenges?

"Function does not start by itself (on pageload)

Hi all,
I would like an animation to autostart on page load. I’m in the Onsen UI V2 JS Splitter example within the ons-template in an ons-page.
I found that adding a script tag between the “/ons-page” and the “/ons-template” tags gets read (this took me quite some time… (-; )
I added this:
document.addEventListener(""init"", function(event) { if (event.target.id == ""score.html"") { Progress1(); } }, false);
Nothing happened.
I added this
setTimeout(function(){ Progress1(); }, 3000);
The function starts! (thank you @Andi ) But only the first time the page is opened. The second time: nothing happens. On reload it usually works (not always).
I added a button that called the function
</ons-toolbar-button> </div> <div class=""right""> <ons-toolbar-button <ons-icon</ons-icon> </ons-toolbar-button>
This always works.
Any ideas why the function won’t start and what to do about it?

"Obituary: Frank Woods, Clos du Bois Founder
Frank Montgomery Woods Jr. engaged life with enthusiasm. He was an active member of the Bohemian Club, The Pacific-Union Club, the California Tennis Club, the Guardsmen and San Francisco Golf Club. Frank was a passionate bridge player and a student of the game. In the last few years, he had been working on an extensive compilation of bridge notes, which he shared with his bridge partners and interested friends.
Frank’s life began 81 years ago, in Chattanooga, Tennessee, the eldest son of Josephine Roberts Woods and Frank Montgomery Woods. He spent his childhood in Birmingham, Alabama, and Nashville, Tennessee, then earned his bachelor’s degree from Cornell University (‘50-‘54), in the School of Hotel Administration. He was a member of the Sigma Phi fraternity.
Following graduation, Frank served in Korea. He was a U.S. Army Second Lieutenant in charge of a quartermaster depot. In 1956, Frank joined the advertising and marketing department of Proctor & Gamble in Cincinnati, Ohio. After five years at P&G, Frank moved to the Bay Area to launch his own company, Marketing Continental, with his friend, Edward Eyre. An entrepreneur at heart, Frank’s company was instrumental in developing and introducing products such as the Pine Mountain Log, Tiger’s Milk (a predecessor of Carnation Instant Breakfast), and the Shell No-Pest Strip, which, at its height, was the largest selling insecticide in the United States. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Frank, together with Cornell classmate Tom Reed, helped to develop and market the Four Seasons Ski Resort in Breckenridge, Colorado.
In 1961, Frank met Kay Harrigan and they married in Mobile, Alabama, a year later. They lived in San Francisco and Healdsburg, and raised three children: Dorine Woods Towle (Griff), Frank Montgomery Woods (Anne Robinson) and Alexis Woods (Daniel Donahoe). They have six grandchildren: Spencer and Audrey Towle, Thea and Keira Donahoe, Ella and Montgomery Woods.
Frank is survived by his brother, Bill Woods (Deborah Freedman), and his sister, Rhoda Reyner. His brother, Joseph Woods, predeceased him.
During the 1960s and 70’s Frank was deeply involved in politics. Although a registered Republican, in 1966 he was tapped to be Chairman of Ronald Reagan’s “Democrats for Reagan” gubernatorial campaign in Northern California. “They needed somebody to get all the Democrats on board,” Frank once said of his role. “I guess I just enjoyed dealing with people of a different persuasion.” In 1968, Reagan tapped Frank again, putting him in charge of 11 southern states, where he was responsible for securing delegates for the Miami convention. Reagan ultimately lost that election to Richard Nixon, but asked Frank to work on his 1970 gubernatorial campaign. Around the same time, Frank was appointed to the California State Personnel Board, where he served as President until 1980.
In the early 1970s, Frank began his notable career in the wine business. In 1974, he co-founded the award-winning Clos du Bois winery in Sonoma County with Tom Reed. Reed and Frank purchased vineyard property outside of Healdsburg, California in the Alexander Valley along the Russian River. From the beginning, Clos du Bois was a wine designed to be as consumer friendly as an American wine and as elegant as a French wine, a combination that was unheard of at the time. near Healdsburg.
Frank became an advocate for the American wine industry, especially for Sonoma County. Over the years Frank was chairman of the Wine Institute, chairman of the American participation in the International Organization of Viticulturalists (OIV), and was on the boards of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Young Audiences of San Francisco, and the L.S.B. Leakey Foundation. In addition, he was a consultant to the wine industries in Bulgaria, Slovenia and Hungary under an agricultural project of the United States government. Frank also represented the US in various international wine negotiations with NAFTA and dealings with GATT in Geneva.
Frank was also very active in the family’s forest products business, Scotch Plywood Company, which operates in Alabama and Mississippi. For many years Frank was a member of the Scotch Board of Directors.
Frank Woods passed away on Thursday, May 8, in San Francisco. There will be a memorial service for Frank on Monday, May 19 at 3:00pm at Grace Cathedral. In lieu of flowers, the Woods family requests that remembrances to the deceased be sent to: Gladstone Foundation,1650 Owens Street, San Francisco, CA 94158; or KIPP Bay Area Schools, 1404 Franklin Street Suite 500, Oakland, CA 94612; or UCSF Diabetes Teaching Center, UCSF Foundation, Lock Box 45339, San Francisco, CA 94145.",http://www.winebusiness.com/people/?go=getPeopleArticle&dataId=132685,2014-11-21 02:31:53,CC-MAIN-2014-49,1416400372542.20,"[array(['/content/image/people/thumbnails/large/FrankWoods001.jpg', None],

Daily Kos is a political weblog founded by Markos Alberto Moulitsas Zúniga, nicknamed “Kos” (pronounced “kose”), who launched the website on May 26, 2002. He continues to maintain it from Berkeley, California, where he resides. In its first year, Daily Kos attracted more than 1.6 million unique visits and about 3 million page views. As of August 2006, it was drawing an average of some 696,500 unique visits per day, or about 20 million per month.
Mr. Zuniga, who in 2003 was retained by the Howard Dean campaign as a technical advisor, describes Daily Kos as follows: “This is a Democratic blog, a partisan blog. One that recognizes that Democrats run from left to right on the ideological spectrum, and yet we're all still in this fight together. We happily embrace centrists like NDN's Simon Rosenberg and Howard Dean, conservatives like Martin Frost and Brad Carson, and liberals like John Kerry, and Barack Obama. Liberal? Yeah, we're around here and we're proud. But it's not a liberal blog. It's a Democratic blog with one goal in mind: electoral victory. … The battle for the party is not an ideological battle. It's one between establishment and anti-establishment factions. And as I've said a million times, the status quo is untenable.”
The Daily Kos front page, which is the first thing a reader sees when visiting the website, contains entries written either by Zuniga (“Kos”) or by any of about a half-dozen people to whom Kos has given front-page posting privileges. These front-page posters each serve what Zuniga calls “one-year terms.”
Apart from the front-page posts, most of Daily Kos’s content appears inside of the “diaries” (entries written by registered users, who are limited to one posting per day) and are then read and commented upon by other users. According to Zuniga, almost all Daily Kos contributors are “ordinary citizens interested in talking about and participating in the political process,” and most of them “fall on the liberal side of the U.S. political spectrum,” though “people of conservative views are welcome to come and debate.”
The Daily Kos’s claims of receptivity to political centrism have frequently been betrayed by the causes the weblog embraces and the language in which it couches its commitments. On April 1, 2004, Zuniga himself posted one of Daily Kos’s most controversial blogs to date. Titled “Screw Them,” the piece ridiculed four American private contractors in Iraq who, the day before, had been ambushed and killed (by guerrillas), mutilated and burned, dragged through the streets of Fallujah, and then publicly hung from a bridge. Zuniga’s post read: “Every death should be on the front.”
In April 2004, Daily Kos initiated dKosopedia, which it describes as “a collaborative project of the DailyKos community.” Modeled after Wikipedia, this is a “political encyclopedia … written from a left/progressive/liberal/Democratic point of view while also attempting to fairly acknowledge the other side's take.” All Daily Kos readers are invited to contribute to dKosopedia. As of August 2006, it consisted of 6,633 articles.
During the 2004 U.S. election cycle, Daily Kos readers donated approximately $500,000 to fifteen Democratic candidates whose campaigns Zuniga identified as being most in need of financial support. Though all fifteen candidates eventually lost at the polls, Zuniga maintained that the project had been successful in that it forced several Republican incumbents to secure their reelection by spending party money that otherwise could have remained in the proverbial Republican “war chest.”
Prominent content contributors to Daily Kos in recent years have included Barbara Boxer, Jimmy Carter, John Conyers, Jon Corzine, Russ Feingiold, Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, Jim McDermott, Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, Cindy Sheehan, and Lynn Woolsey. Below are selected excerpts from some of their postings:
In August 2007, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama appeared as a guest speaker at the Daily Kos national convention. According to a New York Times report: ""Mr. Obama, who has built his candidacy upon the mantra of change, received booming applause when he was introduced to the audience of more than 1,500. When the moderator mentioned that the senator turned 46 years old on Saturday, several of those gathered in the ballroom began to serenade him with 'Happy Birthday.'""

Anything But Ordinary
by: Dark Huntress
Prologue
A lone figure sat against the glow of the full moon, casting a large imposing shadow across the already midnight sky. Long strong arms flexed, forming large fists, as anger coursed through his system. A low snarl ripped past his full lips as the wind picked up and blew a few stray locks into his face. His muscles on his back bunched, rippling the smooth russet skin, as he stood on his feet.
The man was huge, taller than any average man.
He walked away from his perch, every movement he made sending small animals into hiding, their hurried movements echoing in the otherwise silent world. His anger permeated through all the surrounding lands, the home of his forefathers knowing instinctively of his absolute rage and betrayal. He hurt, a raw gaping hole ripping through his chest, growing larger every day.
She had shattered him, hurt him like no one else could, but she had taught him a valuable lesson, never trust an outsider. She had been his world, he had known she was broken, but yet he still loved her, would have taken her even if she had loved another man. Yet the moment the enemy returned, she ran to them, despite the happiness he had given her in her time of grief. She was selfish, inconsiderate, horrid.
No, that was his wolf talking. No. She was none of those things, she was perfect.
He still loved her, knew it deep down, that he would always love her, even if he one day had to fight to end her life. She was the enemy, a threat to his family, his pack, and he would not allow even her to harm them. She was an outsider, plain and simple, and when it came down to it, love or not, his people came first.
Jacob ran, letting the biting wind take away the pain momentarily, it was one of the few things that he enjoyed about his fate. The speed. How he loved to run, to reach speeds beyond imagination and still be in complete control.
Leaving the forest line, Jacob sighed in relief as he came upon the small house in the middle of the small valley. It looked unkept to the untrained eye, the paint in desperate need of a new coat. Shingles were broken, and the windows always had the curtains drawn. But, the glowing orange and red hues of blooming flowers before the dark panes, lit the area with warmth. The small violets and blues instantly welcoming anyone to stop by, that if they were lost, they would soon find their way.
She had done that for him at least, helping him pick up as many pieces as possible, and salvage the most he could of his heart. She had been there, comforting him in away that the other males of his pack could not. She had tenderly heard him through, taught him how to continue, and believed in him more than he did himself. She was a miracle to all of them, the greatest treasure their pack had. They would be crushed if anything were to happen to her.
Knocking on the door, Jacob waited for the owners’ to answer it, the warm scent of bacon and sausage reaching his nose. The scent was cold, having been fixed long since now, but it made him smile all the same, no matter how broken he was, he was always welcomed here.
""Evening, Jacob,"" Sam greeted, stepping aside as the lesser pack member entered his home before shutting the door behind him.
""Hello, Jacob,"" Emily called, untying her apron from around her waist, the small golden wedding band gleaming in the light.
It had been a long engagement, but the two had finally settled down with one another. Sometimes, it would suffocate him and his brothers, the amount of love the two gave off towards each other. Even now, as the two met gazes, it left his stomach clenching and torn chest shudder.
""Would you like some coffee, Jacob?"" Emily asked, already taking the coffee pot off of the stove to pour three mugs full.
""Yes, please,"" Jacob said, smiling at her kindly as he watched her beautiful face smile from beneath the curtain of hair that fell around her.
When he had first met her, he had instantly retracted himself at her appearance, the raw ragged scars disfiguring her beautiful face. Her large almond eye on the one side was always drooping slightly, as if she were about to fall asleep on her feet. On the same side, the corner of her full lips were permanently set into a frown, even if the other side went up in radiant joy. The scars, long and ugly, trailed clear down to her hand, where they finally stopped to give her peace. Yes, at first he thought her hideous, but now, as he looked upon her, he couldn’t find the visage he had seen then. To him, to all of them, she was nothing but pure beauty.
Taking the mug, he watched silently as Emily handed her husband his coffee, and then sat down on their sofa completely exhausted. She hardly got anymore sleep than him, she was always awake when they left for patrols, and always awake with breakfast waiting when they returned. She never complained, and always seemed happy to see the whole pack come for a visit. Yet, Jacob knew she must be feeling the repercussions of the lack of sleep.
""Who’s going with us tonight?"" Jacob asked, sipping his hot coffee as he looked at his leader, rocking slowly back and forth in the chair.
""Embry, Quil, you, and I,"" Sam answered, sighing heavily and rubbing his eyes tiredly, before setting his mug down on the side table.
They fell into a companionable silence, each one thinking of something different, and completely relaxed in the others’ presence. Emily yawned silently, her hands rubbing her temples as if to ward off a headache, her dark eyes closed. A long breath came out, her arms falling to her sides as she rolled her neck, and shrugged her shoulders. The corner of her orange blouse fell slightly, to reveal the juncture of skin between her shoulder and neck.
""What the hell?"" Jacob growled, his eyes bulging as he stared fixedly at Emily, his entire body shook with rage, pure hatred.
""Calm down Jacob, its not what it looks like,"" Sam reasoned, standing to place a warm hand on the larger man’s shoulder.
Emily sat perfectly still, biting her lower lip as she watched cautiously for Jacob to regain some form of control. She knew what he had saw, a bite mark on her flesh, still slightly bruised. It appeared painful, though she hardly felt it. It was clean though, as if there hadn’t been a struggle when it had happened, which didn’t make sense to Jacob in the least. There was no doubt in his mind that Emily would have fought fiercely if a vampire attacked her. Besides, there was no way a vampire got into this territory, not without them knowing. So what was that mark?
""Sit down, Jacob, and I’ll explain,"" Sam said, and Jacob followed his command, falling into the recliner before turning his burning gaze onto his elder.
""Explain,"" Jacob demanded, he had become more and more reckless with the treatment he gave to his leader, it wouldn’t be long before he would challenge Sam, both knew it.
The wolf in Jacob demanded he be the one in control, he had the bloodline and history of it. The wolf inside of him recoiled at the thought of being put into submission, it was of a dominant breed, and would have nothing left.
""Ok, but first, Jacob you must keep this to yourself. You must make sure to not think of this while transformed,"" Sam said, and Jacob nodded, understanding.
""The night of our wedding, Emily was turned into a wolf. It seems, when in time of approaching war, if a wolf takes a mate and his or her saliva some enters their bloodstream they are transformed. It wouldn’t usually be a problem, unfortunately, during are activities,"" Sam said, blushing slightly. ""I found myself to be somewhat aggressive, or a biter. I’m afraid by the next morning Emily had changed.""
""Why don’t you want the other’s to know about this?"" Jacob wondered, it wasn’t like it was a taboo thing, none of the pack would think less of them for it.
""Because, if they knew, they would be afraid to find their intended, and I don’t want them to loose that joy. It may be selfish, but in the long run not as many will get hurt,"" Sam answered honestly, his eyes moving to the ground.
""So what you’re saying is that this only happens when something like that’s about to happen?"" Jacob asked, leaning back heavily into the cushions of the chair.
""So it would seem,"" Sam said, resigning himself.
Jacob shuttered, if there was a great battle coming, what side would Bella be on? She was a cold one now, a bloodsucker, but he was sure that wasn’t the group they had to worry about. No, it was most likely the ones that had been moving from other places to around Forks, circling it always, looking for a way in. Either way, he would have to fight them, even if Bella got in the way.
There was a war coming, and he would be ready.

"It was only after Julie Byrne almost blew up at a stranger in a shop car park that she realised she needed help.
The mother-of-two had been struggling emotionally since returning from hospital for her four-month-old son Alex's cancer treatment.
Ms Byrne was at Parliament House on Thursday to help launch Camp Quality's 'New Normal Navigator' phone app, designed to help families with the challenges of returning home after cancer treatment.
She said she always looked forward to returning home, but found herself out of sync with her family, and struggling with depression and anxiety.
A trip to the shops was her first since returning from the hospital, and her eldest daughter Lucy had banged the car door into a stranger's car.
Ms Byrne, with baby Alex strapped to her chest, saw the driver returning and was already getting angry.
""This gentleman was going to get up me about a stupid little dint in his car, when I had been fighting this big battle with my son,"" Ms Byrne said.
""It must have boiled up on my face.""
She said the driver took one look at her and drove off.
""I didn't realise I needed help until that point,"" Ms Byrne said.
Alex, now 12, is cancer free and healthy.
The app - Ms Byrne's brain child - provides information and therapy tips for families, as well as services like meal delivery.
Ms Byrne said sometimes every little thing helped.
""That's what this app is about, it's to take the pressure off and ease back to normality,"" Ms Byrne said.
Speaking at the launch of the government-funded app, Health Minister Greg Hunt said even at the best of times, families had to adapt to the ""new normal"" when young ones were undergoing treatment.
He said each year over 800 Australians aged under 15 will be diagnosed with cancer, and 100 of them won't survive.

"Oklahoma ER & Hospital Receives FDA Authorized Cellex Antibody Test for COVID-19 By NutexMarketing | May 18, 2020 | Comments Off on Oklahoma ER & Hospital Receives FDA Authorized Cellex Antibody Test for COVID-19 /> Contact: Makailyn Dillion Director of Marketing mdillon@okerhospital.com EDMOND, Okla., May 18, 2020—Oklahoma ER & Hospital can now test for COVID-19 antibodies in-house using the Cellex antibody test. This test is the first of its kind to be authorized by the FDA through the Emergency Use Authorization process on April 1. Due to the overwhelming demands of the national pandemic, supplies of Cellex have been constrained. However, Oklahoma ER & Hospital is now among the certified medical facilities with this “game-changing” serology test. Antibody testing is also known as serology testing, which checks for the presence of antibodies, or unique proteins created in response to infections. Antibodies are created by the immune system to protect the body from allergens, bacteria, and viruses. By testing the level of antibodies in someone’s blood, it can determine if they had an immune response to the infection or if they were previously infected. The Cellex test looks for two types of antibodies, IgG and IgM, which rise as the body mounts an immune reaction to fight off the SARS-COV2 virus. The Cellex test requires a small blood sample and a laboratory certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) to analyze the results. Fortunately, Oklahoma ER & Hospital’s laboratory is both CLIA and COLA certified. CLIA is a federal government standard for ensuring quality laboratory testing of humans. Meanwhile, COLA Inc. is a leading national laboratory accreditor whose program and standards enable clinical laboratories and staff to meet U.S. CLA and other regulatory requirements. Once the blood is drawn, it will be tested in-house for COVID-19 indicators using the Cellex kit. Results from the test will appear after approximately 20 minutes, keeping anticipation to a minimum. Although there is uncertainty as to whether the development of antibodies to COVID-19 necessarily suggest long-term immunity, Oklahoma ER & Hospital can also offer the standard PCR testing in addition to the antibody testing. The Cellex antibody test will be exceptionally beneficial for individuals, as well as employers and public health officials, to determine whether they have been exposed to COVID-19 and have developed an immune response. We encourage the public to take serious precautions regarding your health during this time.

Season in review: When training camp opened, Reed was still recovering from the torn ACL he suffered late in the 2011 season. He started the season on the PUP list and returned to action in December. His return helped out a special teams unit that was depleted some due to injuries to starters. Reed also made his first NFL catch in a Week 15 loss. In five regular-season games, he had five catches for 66 yards.
Signature moment: In the third quarter of a lopsided loss to the Denver Broncos, Reed caught a pass from quarterback Joe Flacco for a 12-yard gain. It was an insignificant play in that game, but a huge one for Reed, a former 2010 fifth-round pick who had finally made his first career catch in his third NFL season.
Stat that stands out: six -- special teams tackles in eight games for Reed, according to Pro Football Focus.
Pro Football Focus grade: 0.0 overall | 0.0 as a receiver | -1.0 on special teams.
Outlook for 2013 and beyond: The Ravens brought back Reed, who was a restricted free agent, with a two-year, $2.5 million contract. He will be in the battle during training camp to replace Anquan Boldin's snaps. Reed can also secure a roster spot on special teams. He may not be a popular player amongst the fans after fumbling twice in an ugly loss in Seattle in 2011, but the team feels he can be a very good special teams player.

"Sunday 11th September
The alarm on our clock is set for 9am so sometimes when I am felling naughty I will press the button and display the alarm time instead of the real time. Using that method this morning resulted in Lucy getting up at 8am. It’s Sunday and oh how I laughed when she found out… and then she kicked me.
Here’s our view this morning, vineyards in front of us, the Moselle just beyond that and then the other bank with vineyards squeezed into every slightly not vertical space. I unhitched the bikes and we cycled into Cochem, a beautiful medieval town about 4 miles away. Did I say 4 miles? Something I forgot to tell Lucy but it was dead flat all the way and she was barely wheezing by the time we got there.
This is one of the reasons why people flock here in their thousands, even at early o’clock it was busy, lots of cafes and restaurants open but thankfully all the jewellery shops were locked up tight.
This is the Reichsburg (Imperial Fortress) built 900 years ago and destroyed when the pesky French came visiting in 1689.
After locking our bikes up and Lucy insisting that we were not, under any circumstances, climbing up to the castle, we climbed up to the castle but decided not to go in, once you’ve seen inside one castle you’ve seen inside one castle.
The town itself was full of interesting (closed) shops with lots of twisty turny streets, very pleasant.
After cycling back another 4 miles it was still only 10.30am, she has refused to do anything else for the rest of the day which is why I am writing this in a free stellplatz in Koblenz after having had to cook lunch and supply ice creams. We’ve decided to hit Koblenz tomorrow and have the rest of the day off and make some vital planning decisions.
I have to say that my route planning has been thrown a curve ball.

"Masonry Retrofit
A great number of historic masonry buildings exist across North America, and today they are being re-imagined with an endless variety of uses. Renovating and reoccupying these old buildings is rightly considered an act of sustainability in itself. Using the existing structure can mean 50% to 75% less embodied carbon, on day one of occupancy, than a new building would generate.
In the 21st century, our existing masonry buildings also need to be made as energy efficient as possible to help fight climate change. Their operational energy use should be reduced to Passive House levels that can result in net zero emissions. This can be done safely and robustly, so there is no excuse for historic masonry buildings to not aggressively address efficiency.
The approach to a retrofit project varies depending on whether or not the historic character of the building can be changed. They may be in a historic district or be specifically designated as historic landmarks, leaving little choice in design alterations. Does the exterior need to be preserved? Can the building be wrapped from the outside? What’s the condition of the exterior and/or interior details? No matter the case, we can still make these old building enclosures very robust and efficient. masonry retrofit videos",https://foursevenfive.com/masonry-retrofit/,2020-01-17 17:31:51,CC-MAIN-2020-05,1579250589861.0,"[array(['https://cdn8.bigcommerce.com/s-rcf6fypx3d/product_images/uploaded_images/masonry-icon-round.png?t=1540411105&_ga=2.119877568.956759934.1540216461-60737476.1536594427',

Doillon's ease with young performers is again seamlessly evident; the nonpro kids aren't artless so much as unaffected, and all but lead actress Touly share names with their characters. The essentially parentless petits frères and their aggrieved new soeur loiter in the park, talk trash, orchestrate motorbike-jackings, and run errands for the bigger boys, who traffic in guns, sometimes attract swarms of police, and serve as de facto guidance counselors and job coaches. As a study of a multiethnic, rigidly structured social hierarchy in the hard-knock suburbs, Petits Freres often seems like a prologue to Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine (or even a junior side-story), matching its rhythms of aimless downtime exploded by upheavals of violence. Doillon's film, jagged with jump cuts, might be too determined in its frayed, offhand sprawl (a thread involving Talia's younger sister, who's now alone with their stepfather, is picked up and quickly discarded). Some of the commotions are clumsily staged, especially once Talia acquires her own pistol. Petits Freres hardly lacks for mordant wit, though, its outlook abruptly switching to cautious optimism by the last reel. There's an air of forced camaraderie to Doillon's ensemble farewell scenea vision of spontaneous self-celebration that's hard to believe and hard to begrudge.
Amy
Directed by Nadia Tass
Written by David Parker
World Wide
It's far too easy to hold a grudge against Nadia Tass's stultifying Amy, which would set a new bar for mawkish exploitation of a child's suffering if its every situation and character weren't so laughably bogus. After witnessing her Aussie rockstar father's gruesome electrocution death during a rain-pounded stadium show, a four-year-old apparently falls deaf and muteonly, as her protective mother (Rachel Griffiths) soon discovers, the girl can in fact sing and hear music! The movie really starts coughing up candy-colored bile once a samaritan shrink enters the picture (wee Amy finds Mummy in Rorschach blots and looks appropriately stricken when Doctor holds up the sign, ""Where Is Your Father?""), but a cacophonous climax in which the child learns to Live Again via sadistic primal therapy plumbs new depths of craven heartstring-yanking. Surely taking cues from Doillon, Amy is Ponette's haplessly evil twin.

Are you having this kind of a day? Is your computer to blame? I can relate!
When your PC starts to lose steam, sometimes a simple upgrade can solve your problem. In other cases, it may be smarter to start fresh with a new machine. You can save time, money and hassle by learning to make the distinction yourself. Whether you're a Mac or Windows user, here's your simplified plan of action.
The fundamental concept to understand is that your computer may slow down when its memory fills up. Sometimes the solution is a quick fix, so begin by cleaning up your desktop.
- Be honest with yourself: which programs do you no longer use? Begin by uninstalling these, even if they've developed sentimental value just by being those familiar, unused icons on your desktop. They have to go.
- ...so does the outdated Internet Explorer browser with toolbars and plugins that slow down your Internet. Get the renovated Internet Explorer 9 instead, or opt for Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. All three are good browsers, and can be easily downloaded for free from their respective websites.
- Clear your browser's cache (the temporary data files automatically stored by your computer every time you go on the Internet). This process will be different depending on your browser, but a quick internet search will take you step by step in under two minutes.
If your computer is still lagging, it's definitely time for at least an upgrade in hardware. Here are a few ways to add memory space to your device.
- Buy more RAM memory by the chip.
- Buy a larger hard drive.
- Even better, advance from a hard drive to a solid-state drive (SSD). Unlike the traditional hard drive, SSDs use innovative flash memory, making your device move practically at the speed of light (well...really fast!).
- Inspired by recent events, don't forget to consider your wireless router as a source of your computer's connectivity problem. Replace it with one of higher bandwidth if you find yourself constantly having to reboot.
When all else fails, invest in a new PC.
- If you've tried one or more of the above options and performance still isn't up to par, it may be time for a replacement. You never want to end up having spent more money on repairs than it would've cost to start fresh with a new machine.
- With a new computer, minimize the potential for future issues with regular checkups, always backing up your data (there are plenty of software packages to choose from or even online services), and keeping your programs, especially your antivirus software, updated.

Turkey Arrests Suspected Former ISIS Executioner In Bursa
ISTANBUL, Turkey (AFP) – Turkish police have arrested a suspected former executioner for Islamic State in Syria, who became a gas repairman when he returned to civilian life in Turkey, local media reported on Tuesday, February 18.
The 50-year-old Syrian, known by his nickname “Abu Taki al-Shami,” was arrested at a construction site on Monday in the Bursa province of northwest Turkey, state news agency Anadolu said.
The agency described him as an executioner for a senior ISIS leader in the Deir Ezzor region of eastern Syria, a former stronghold of the extremist group.
A video of his arrest showed him in work clothes and closely shaved.

Is this normal with a grey card? I even had to shut of 15,000 lumens of light....but it made no difference.....
Also, for the heck of it....I put on a CPL after the above setup and it made everything a lot darker inside for product photography and did not bring out a better color....I had to try it.
So, AWB is achieving close to what the Grey card is.....what am I not doing right?

Ma girl Heather, I bow and salute you. Already done forward it to all my peeps, signed it too. Let us try hard to keep this alive for a time. We should also pressure the BA to tell us what was reported about Ernest Jackman in the form of complaints against his name. The BA association should also tell us why the system is designed to place lawyers in wrong-doing before a court of their peers in the form of a disciplinary committee and not a court of law. We must press to get all citizens regardless of status or title, and who commit acts that are illegitimate and criminal, to be tried before a court of law and not a fraternity bullshit set up of their own peers. You feeling me, sis?

The hunt for crooked lawyers could get wider based on the horde summoned to the bar yesterday.

Law is important that cant be denied but the droves entering the field yearly is over saturation and poor use of billions spent in free education. The CJ opined many will struggle to get work. Therein lies the conundrum.
Even so many will become millionaires a key reason they chose the profession but what of the Archer’s and the Jackie Stewart’s and the old guy in the wheelchair who were robbed blind.
Lawyers charged as thieves or accused of malfeasance are rising and the profession’s reputation is in tatters.
Its government’s duty to protect the society from vultures never mind the form in which they appear.
@ Donks
A low barrier to enter. Not an intellectual or academic challenge. Even more, is their detachment from ordinary people. As a profession it is the great failure of post-independent Barbados.
Does the government still underwrite tuition fees for lawyers at UWI.

As I have said before, one of the easiest courses at university. Sixty-one of them were admitted to the Bar yesterday. Is this country serious about developing? Lawyers are talkers, you only have listen to Mia. She is in love with her voice. I sincerely hope she doesn’t believe half of what she is saying. The world is technologically driven and here we are putting out lawyers left ,right and center for them to do more stealing. What about the hard courses (like physics. mathematics, chemistry, engineering, microbiology and cellular and molecular biology)? Courses that create things and grow the economy of a country.. Instead we have a group of pompous crooks walking around in black suits (seem to have ignored Max Planck law about black bodies being the most efficient absorbers of heat energy) and wigs looking totally stupid in their outfits.

The most idiotic thing i have ever seen, lawyers depend on the population to hire them just to survive, just so they can eat, of course they are so pompous they will try to pretend this is not true, the ones in Barbados most of them are too toxic to interact with the public. And of course given the current economic down turn, who is going to hire any of them, particularly when most have such bad reputations and these are the same crooks whose firms will recruit these new lawyers, look how most of them have turned out over the years after being mentored by the top lawyers accused of land theft, theft of money, theft of estates on the island, same wicked system these new lawyers will be assimulated into..
They should limit the amount of people who take this course, what are they bringing to the table except more theft and arrogance and a backlogged court sytem filled with corruption, they will have to play along to get along or starve…
They are not too intelligent to begin with and regurgitate all the shite they were fed at UWI which was written by other people while making up more shite to do their criminal deeds, a total waste of time. The island needs LESS lawyers, not MORE.
This is a fraud probate, look at the names involved, even a recently promoted judge or 2…are involved, the daughter and beneficiary to the estate claimed the well known crooks from the bar and supreme court are stealing her father’s estate for some muslim crook……they are so criminal and organized, their well placed fellow thieves in UK tried to clean out this deceased man’s bank account without the knowledge of his family but the bank was on top of it and called in CFO, it is now an investigation….they should all be in prison for this clear theft from an elderly, sick, dying and now deceased man……stinking thieves posing as lawyers, judges etc in Barbados. Everyone is at risk from the vipers.'s bank account but the bom/story.php?story_fbid=1137190156490522&id=100005986451739
Here is the link, error above.
It is time for these evil criminals from the bar association be locked up for colluding to rob estates of black bajans who return from UK, US etc…let’s see how far they are willing to go just to be common class thieves.
Let’s see how far they go before someone physically destroys one or 2 of them…for being the thieves that they are.
that is the same lady stood up at Mia’s joke conference in UK and asked about elder fraud and abuse in Barbados, everyone heard Mia tell her to go to the Barbados police, she took a flight from UK to do just that, the police told her point blank the only one who cares about her father in Barbados is her and her family is fcked up..,that is the sickness they all seem to be afflicted with…all of them.

I really can’t let you get away with insulting people none, or few of whom you have ever met.
Simple…you call it insulting …as usual i call it reality..
who do you think is going to mentor these young lawyers and in whose ALREADY ESTABLISHED OFFICE, they will intern for a time…if they do not leave the country and spread their wings out of that rat trap…well let me tell you who will be their mentors, the same THIEVES AND CROOKS WHO all now have the court system so corrupt, the same thieves and crooks who CONTROL every aspect of the judiciary…the same thieves and crooks without whom, they will not be allowed to practice law if they show themselves to be TOO HONEST…so put that in ya pipe and smoke it..
@Donks Gripe and JoshOctober 12, 2019 11:33 AM “Even so many will become millionaires.”
If some or many become millionaires it can only be because Bajans too love runnning to lawyers with every damn little thing. Some us can’t even settle who should wash the dishes or sweep the yard in our own families. Imagine going to court and each parent hiring a lawyer in order to ensure that a child is financially supported.
I am no lawyer but this is how I have advised “clients” If you doubt that the child is yours, pay for and get a DNA test. If the child is yours go to the supermarket and find out how much food costs. Find out how much clothes cost. Find our how much medical and education costs. Find our how much housing cost, find out how much recreation cost, and every payday have your employer deposit 50% of that amount directly into the custodial parent’s bank account. If you are self employed deposit the 50% yourself once a week, or fortnight or month. Don’t be like an ignorant fellow I know who wanting to “punish” the mother, ended up punishing his own children because he waited deposited the amount on the last day of the year after the mother had struggled to meet 100% of the expenses all year. No wonder his children did not speak to him in his old age. Idiot.
if we were reasonable people we would need very few lawyers, but alas…
Lawyers become fat and rich because we like ‘um so.

Our education systems need to be retooled towards a mindset of building a nation
At present the country is bulit on selfinterest and gratification reason they are so many lawyers
What does it say about a country who has to resort to the mentally challenged people to pick up the garbage
It says that the mindset of this country is one which resort to quicke fixes instead of solutions that taxes the brain for preparedness
What does it say about a country whose former Speaker would have withheld the money of a 70 year old man tied to a wheelchair and allowed to continue in the role by a former Prime Minister? You have zero credibility on the blog.
Let us agree that crooks populate both sides of the political divide.
Let us agree that both parties have not brought solutions for any of the pressing problems confronting Barbados
Let us agree that we do not have:
FOI or sunshine laws
integrity legislation
judicial reform or control of lawyers
systems that work as they should
new systems that effectively/efficiently replace old broken systems
an education system that gears us towards 2050
fewer lawyers than are needed

“It is country that forced those 61 people to be lawyers or did they make a personal decision to qualify for the profession?
How does their personal choice equate with is this country serious about developing?”
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
It was indeed a “personal” decision by those 61 baby-faced lawyers to go into a dead-end profession which has no bright future in an increasingly Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven world.
But you ought to be aware of the larger point being made here about the law profession in Barbados.
If, as you say, going into the profession is a personal decision and not based on any national development need why are the Bajan taxpayers being asked to help underwrite the cost of their academic tuition and the Cave Hill campus?
Can you say with a measure of comfort that the citizens of Barbados are receiving good judicial value for the high cost of legal training they have been asked to finance over the years?
The only good reason why so many lawyers are trained to add to the already overmanned and excessively dysfunctional legal system is justify the presence of the Law Faculty at the Cave Hill campus.
For without that faculty the Bajan policymakers and authorities would find it exceedingly hard-pressed to justify the existence of the Cave Hill campus as a stand alone institution.
Its future viability as a tertiary training institution could be secured only as a ‘school’ of higher learning under the umbrella of a restructured tertiary teaching and learning organism called the University of Barbados with the BCC, the Polytechnic and the morphing of all secondary schools sixth forms into one channel being its symbiotic relatives.
What would it say about a country who continues to make same mistakes over and over again
At present govt has a Minister namely George Payne whose name is drag all over social media having to do with illegal wrong doings
Yet u David supports this govt
So much hypocrisy

How in the name of commonsense do you find the power to continue to support the likes of a crooked is ass DLP while wanting to condemn the BLP for the shame shite that the DLP did? How do the wrongdoings of one crook make another crook (doing similiar) a perfect justification for your type of condemnation you are bringing in this matter? Blind loyalty got you seeing through one eye, while you closing the next to all the shite that the DLP committed. You not realise yet that Mia has not got na problem at all with ”waywards,” controversial figures, and those accused of fleecing, lining her party. Jesus H Christ, when Glyne Murray made his intentions clear what his agenda will be by indicating that ministers should be paid more, you think she would have made a public example of him to appease John Public that she in playing with any minister who speaks out of context? Stuart approached those in his line up doing shite with silence. Even if he castigate them in private, by their actions and doings alone, the notion was held that he had no impact whatsoever on them, so the shite continued under his poor rakey leadership. How in tarnation can your shite loyalty be so strong for the worst leadership Barbados history? You do well to focus on Rogue Works and accept that the DLP was bare shite. Unless you got bittle.
Mia said she was going to bring the crooks to justice
One year later George Payne still is a minister and sits on an integrity board
All the nameless DLP ministers she said theif from govt not one name has she mentioned or seen fit to have investigated
But how can she after all her cabinet consist of the same wrong doings she accused past govt ministers
Oh still waiting on the promise Mia made of releasing her ministers portfolios to the public by way of transparency

You are right. I met one 40 years ago for a mortgage matter. He did his job. I paid him. I haven’t seen him since.
Met another last century about an estate matter. He did his job. I paid him. I haven’t seen him since.
I met another for a minor family matter more than tw decades ago. She did her job pro bono. I haven’t seen her since.
I’ve met my MP who is a lawyer maybe two or three times in the 15 or 20 years since he has been my representative. We had a major problem in our community. He solved the problem (with our tax money, lolll!!!). I rarely see him. I don’t need to see him. I don’t want to see him.
I don’t socialise with lawyers. I socialise with people who work the land.
Which is what I am out the door now to do. No lawyers required. A lawyer might be a hindrance, not a help to the real-real work that I do.
Ah gone.
Less lawyers are A MUST…
,..Simple, they are not even an 1/8 as important as they think they are and the lack of knowledge population believe them to be…get rid of 3/4 of them, stop allowing them into the parliament and watch the difference.
I am puzzled by the dead silence of Archer’s remaining family and this lawyer. I know it is wrong to speculate but how could anyone be silent on 2.7 million payout to a family member now deceased? How a lawyer who is now in the public domain remain silent as well. Something is not adding up in this case.

I don’t understand how the guy didnt get his money, but now it will turn into a mystery of who have his money, and why didnt he receive his money while he was alive so he could live a normal happy life. Lawyers have a board where you can make a complaint, but its dormant and maybe run by the same crooked lawyers.Mia said she’s getting to the bottom of this, this should’ve happen before the man died. All that money should’ve been accessible to him only, he should’ve got his settlement, and pay the lawyers and have the remaining monies for himself.
This is extremely sad. Should not be happening. Hope his family can get to the bottom of it.
Keep this issue alive and real, how on earth this lawyer or lawyers can sleep at night. The man was relying on his money for total care. Lawyers been crooking people in Barbados for ages. People need to always have copies of whatever you gave a lawyer, never gave them your original documents. This same thing happen with the woman that died and left a huge house worth in the high thousands, because she went senile with age, but when she was healthy she never demanded her documents. The lawyer tried to claim her property. I hope another lawyer help you out pro bono, and I wish this guy had lived to enjoy his money. He would’ve been still alive if he had more care and support.
The issue will be kept lived. I am just bothered about the silence on the part of this man’s remaining family. Looka, if he was my relative I would be huffing and puffing to get to the bottom of where the 2.7 million hanging out.

Kale FAQs
Can I grow kale in containers? Yes, but only in a large container 24 inches deep and wide. Be sure to use a commercial container mix rather than garden soil.
Is kale winter hardy? Kale can tolerate frost and temperatures as low at 10 degrees F, and the flavor in fact becomes sweeter when it has experienced frost.
My kale is blooming! Is it alright? Kale can bolt the following spring when it overwinters in your garden. When the temperatures begin to warm it can send up a flower stalk because it is a biennial plant that produces flowers and seed the second year of its life cycle. The leaves will become more bitter when it bolts.
Should I cook kale or consume it raw? Kale may be used raw or cooked.
Should I grow kale in spring or fall? You can grow kale for either season, but a frost will make it taste sweeter in fall.",http://www.burpee.com/gardenadvicecenter/encyclopedia/vegetables/learn-about-kale/encyclopedia__Kale-article.html,2017-01-16 21:48:22,CC-MAIN-2017-04,1484560279368.44,"[array(['http://demandware.edgesuite.net/abaq_prd/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-siteCatalog_Burpee_US/default/dwb73d5a0b/Category Content Images/CLP Vegetables/CATID-2350_Kale.jpg',

"Browsing the fragments of Early Greek Philosophy by Heraclitus, Empedocles and Diogenes et al I have made some startling and humorous discoveries of the thoughts of Heraclitus inscribed here for your delectation:
‘Exhalations are given off by the earth and the sea, some of them bright and pure, others dark. Fire is increased by the bright exhalations, moisture by the others. He does not indicate what the surrounding heaven is like. But there are bowls in it, their hollow side turned toward us […] The sun and the moon are eclipsed when the bowls turn upwards. The moon’s monthly changes of shape come about as its bowl gradually turns.
and here in this combination of the comic and the tragic:
‘In the end he became a misanthrope, leaving the city where he fed on plants and herbs. Because of this he contracted dropsy and returned to the town. He asked the doctors in his riddling fashion if they could change a rainstorm into a drought. When they failed to understand him, he buried himself in a byre [barn, cowshed], hoping that the dropsy would be vaporized by the heat of the dung. But he met with no success even by this means and died at the age of sixty.’
